# Cursor Rules for thehellmaker-site

## Project Context
Personal tech blog built with Astro, React, and Tailwind. Focus on systems programming, databases, and ML topics.

## Code Style

### TypeScript/React
- Functional components only
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Destructure props in function signature
- Use Tailwind classes, avoid inline styles
- Keep components focused and small

### Blog Posts
- Write in markdown or MDX
- Use direct, technical language
- No em dashes (use colons, periods, commas instead)
- Avoid LLM-sounding phrases like "fascinating", "elegant", "Key insight:"
- Include working code examples
- Math with KaTeX: `$inline$` and `$$block$$`

### Astro
- Use `.astro` for static layouts
- Use React (`.tsx`) for interactive components
- Add `client:load` directive for React components in MDX

## Don'ts
- Don't add unnecessary abstractions
- Don't over-engineer simple things
- Don't create files unless asked
- Don't use emojis in code or technical writing
- Don't write overly formal or "textbook" style content

## File Locations
