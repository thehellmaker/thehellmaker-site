			<p class="blog-description">I write about ML engineering, distributed systems, and production infrastructure. These posts are my learning notes, written with LLM assistance. I'm a fan of LLMs and won't pretend otherwise. I direct the content, review everything, and work to keep the slop out. I try to go as deep as possible so the value you get (or I get when I revisit) is worth more than the feeling that it's just LLM-generated filler.</p>
