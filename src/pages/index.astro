				A note on how I write: I use LLMs to help generate content. I'm a huge fan of LLMs and won't pretend I write every word myself. These posts are a record of my learning, and I can produce better-framed explanations with LLM assistance than I could alone. I'm the director here: I review everything, add details at my level of understanding, and keep refining my prompts and rules to make the output useful. It's my responsibility to remove the slop, and I'll keep working at it.
