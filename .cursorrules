# Cursor Rules

Astro blog with React components and Tailwind. Learning notes written with LLM assistance.

## Code
- TypeScript, functional components
- Tailwind for styling
- `client:load` for React in MDX

## Files
- Posts: `src/content/blog/*.md` or `*.mdx`
- Components: `src/components/`
- Images: `public/`

## Writing Style

Technical posts. Direct and clean.

### Avoid (LLM tells)
- Em dashes (—). Use : . , or () instead
- "Key insight:", "Intuition:", "Let's dive in"
- "fascinating", "elegant", "powerful", "remarkable"
- Fake discovery intros ("I wanted to understand...")
- "Part 1:", "Part 2:" numbered sections
- Tables and bullets for everything
- Emojis
- Summaries that repeat what was said

### Do
- Say what the post is about upfront
- Link sources early (repos, videos, papers)
- Code first, then explanation
- Short sentences
- Credit original work
